 Movie Recommendation System - MSc Data Science Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a *hybrid recommendation system* that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based). The goal is to enhance recall, precision, and RMSE metrics for movie recommendations.

This work is part of my MSc Data Science final project at the University of Hertfordshire.
